# Fatal Police Shootings Analysis
Final Project for Data Science 3: Advanced Modeling Techniques 



Using data gathered by [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/), the factors involving fatal police shootings are examined using two different methods. Through PCA and K-means clustering, it is possible to see that these shootings can be put into different categories to examine the difference between groups. Association analysis allows the frequently occurring observations and rules between precursors and outcomes to be identified. These methods can help policy makers understand how to create better training or policies to possibly prevent fatal outcomes.
